                            Document management tasks and approval processes are among the worst culprits when it comes to busy work. Whether you have to constantly rename URLs and files or just need to sort and tag your resources, your team’s time could be better spent on something else. ESW Associates has been helping people solve these problems since 2006.

                <p class="text-secondary">
                    Whenever a new client contacts us, we go back to the proven playbook that we’ve been using for years to ensure that everyone gets precisely the kind of SharePoint Workflow Automation they need for success.
                </p>
                <p class="text-secondary">
                    A good portion of this comes from the fact that we leverage form-building technology that your company already has access too. SharePoint comes with dozens of tools that are every bit as arcane as they are useful. Our consultants are Microsoft-certified and ready to find the best ways to implement these tools in your own place of business.

                <p class="text-secondary">
                    Our pre-project process will ensure your needs are met, responsibly. It's very easy to go over your stated budget when you're executing any kind of technology-based plan. By producing a map first, we'll be able to prevent this common problem from rearing its ugly head.

                <p class="fs-5 fw-medium">Aesthetics do matter</p>
                <p class="text-secondary">
                    Designing end-user friendly forms & automation are extremely important to us. While SharePoint is an efficient platform, it can be hard to customize and the default look is relatively boring. Since you probably don't want your custom intranet to offer the same exact user experience that everyone else does, we can put together something with a much more personal touch on it.
                </p>

                <p class="text-secondary">
                    You may not realize what else we can pack into our work. Crews might not engage with the default interface that Microsoft SharePoint has to offer, but they'll be more than happy to work with the design we provide. Few people are going to get really excited about the design of a document storage repository, but we have the tools and skills needed to make pages that do something truly special.
