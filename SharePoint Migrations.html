                                A file server migration to SharePoint Online or On Premise should not be under estimated.  Yes it is just files.  However, the following aspects we focus on heavily during this migration to ensure it is a success:
                                <ul class="text-secondary list-group-numbered">
                                    <li>1. The overall amount of content.  File servers tend to have very large amounts of data.  Does all of it need to move?  Where should it move to in order to keep your active content fresh and easily accessible.</li>
                                    <li>2. What underlying security is in place, if any?  Many file servers have security on folders within folders.  How does  that translate to Office 365 and SharePoint permissions and security?</li>
                                    <li>3. How do users normally find files?  This experience is about to change.  Are your users ready for that change?</li>
                                    <li>4. SharePoint comes with a lot of new features and functionality.  Do your users want all that new functionality?  Or should we disable some of it to get started?</li>
                                    <li>5. Are you as a company ready to support the above questions when they arise after the migration is complete?  Or do you need a company like eSoftware Associates to support those questions initially or on an ongoing basis?</li>
                                </ul>

SharePoint 2010 is at the end of its life, per Microsoft.  We have been working with the platform since it was first introduced which enables us to know exactly what it takes to migrate to a newer platform.

                                SharePoint 2013 was the last major SharePoint edition where Microsoft was trying to add additional services to the platform.  The original intent was to offer more services that could be bought and added to SharePoint 2013 which would further enrich the product.  SharePoint 2013 was also being developed during the inception of SharePoint Online.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                Since then, Microsoft and companies everywhere have learned this model created a lot of additional work, errors and confusion.  The additional services were deprecated and removed in SharePoint 2016 and never made it to SharePoint Online.

                                SharePoint 2016 is the first SharePoint platform to introduce the modern UI.  You may or may not be using it, but we will have in depth conversations on how to unify the user experience if you are split between the two.  Your SharePoint 2016 migration to SharePoint Online will open up a new world of functionality which can require end user and admin training.  We typically do not recommend migrating from SharePoint 2016 to SharePoint 2019, but happy to discuss the reasons why.

                                If you are migrating to SharePoint 2019, you must consider many factors.  Information for SharePoint 2019 is inter-mixed with SharePoint Online information.  We highly recommend consulting with SharePoint experts to ensure you fully understand what benefits you are gaining by migrating to SharePoint 2019.

                                Plenty of companies start using Dropbox to send large files. They then realize they are missing out on many features that come with SharePoint.  Two of the biggest aspects of changing from Dropbox to SharePoint are training and communications.  Users want to know why the switch is being made and what are the benefits when migrating from Dropbox to SharePoint.  Other key factors often include internal and external file sharing and how those will operate in the future.

                                The G Suite is Googles set of tools that try to stack up with Office 365.  Companies migrate from G Suite to Office 365 for usually 3 main reasons:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>1. The companies other tools or customers are reliant on Microsoft.</li>
                                    <li>2. Business apps can be custom tailored using Power Apps.</li>
                                    <li>3. Business automation and integration is much more robust with Power Automate.</li>
                                </ul>
                                There are a lot of tools within the G Suite so it is important to inventory what exactly is being migrated to SharePoint Online.  A strong migration plan is necessary including end user communications and strategic migration paths to minimize business disruption.

                                Box migrations are similar to Dropbox migrations.  Companies start out with Box and realize that Office 365 offers so much more with Teams, OneDrive, Power Apps and Power Automate.  It is important to have a strong training program and communication plan when migrating from Box to SharePoint Online.

                                Lotus Notes is one of the older file management platforms.  It can be complex to get information from Lotus Notes to SharePoint, but we have you covered!  One of the hardest aspects is redesigning your file security to align with SharePoint.  We place a strong emphasis on what the desired state of security will be for your company so it is scalable for the future.  It is also important to thoroughly understand all the new SharePoint features and functionality and how compare to what was offered in Lotus Notes.

                        <p class="text-secondary">
                          The initial phase of our SharePoint migration process is the SharePoint pre-migration. This crucial step requires significant time investment. We meticulously configure the necessary architecture and implement robust security measures before proceeding with content migration. Additionally, we set up your SharePoint migration tool and define content mappings, specifying which content will be migrated and its corresponding destination within the new environment.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-secondary">
                          Once the initial setup is complete, we proceed with the pre-migration phase, which has zero impact on your day-to-day operations. During this stage, we securely copy a significant portion of your data to the new location or a staging area that closely resembles your final destination. The duration of this process depends on factors such as the number of content migration locations and the chosen migration tool. As a rough estimate, we typically achieve a rate of 50GB per hour, although we can optimize for faster speeds if required. Rest assured, we closely monitor the pre-migration to ensure a smooth and successful transition.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-secondary">
                          In some cases, we may need to convert existing applications or technical processes to newer technologies. These conversions are treated separately from content migration and are addressed during the requirements gathering, planning, review, and approval stages.

                          Once the pre-migrations are completed, we collaborate with the relevant business and technical stakeholders to conduct thorough testing to ensure everything functions as intended. Testing is scheduled based on the size and scope of the migration, allowing stakeholders to evaluate content placement, security, navigation, and other aspects. By testing tasks as they become available, we ensure a comprehensive assessment of the migration results.

                          Throughout the training process, we will assess and determine the level of support required by your company. While some organizations have internal technical staff and users who can effectively support SharePoint, others may benefit from external support. eSoftware Associates is equipped to provide short or long-term assistance based on your specific needs.

                            SharePoint Full Migration

                        <p class="text-sencondary">
                          Once your company has determined the appropriate support plan aligned with the features and functionality you utilize, the next step is to synchronize your SharePoint content. Surprisingly, this process is typically quicker than expected. The efficiency is largely attributed to Step 4, the pre-migration, where a significant portion of the content was already migrated and tested by your end users without affecting production. Although this step may require some scheduled business downtime, we strive to minimize the impact to ensure a smooth transition. Clear communication regarding the downtime will be provided in advance.

                    Migrations can be done in as little as a week while some migrations can take months. It depends how much content is migrating as well as what complexities need to be accounted for. The typical SharePoint migration is about a month on average.
